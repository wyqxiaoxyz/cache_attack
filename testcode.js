// Theoretically, on average there should be no difference in access times
// in our two retrievals.  However, running this script
// will demonstrate that there is a marked difference between the
// the two retrievals.  The reason is because before the first retrieval,
// we make sure the L3 cache on the processor is full of the evictionBuffer.
// The first retrieval causes the value to be cached in L3, so that
// on the second retrieval, the processor does not have to go to RAM
// to retrieve the value.  Instead, it can retrieve it from L3.

// The third and the fourth tests are provided as controls to validate that we
// can reproduce the results by performing the same actions in a different order.

// we use this buffer to evict everything from L3
